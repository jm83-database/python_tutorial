      "The 2023 Australian Open was a Grand Slam level tennis tournament held at Melbourne Park, from 16–29 January 2023. It was the 111th edition of the Australian Open, the 55th in the Open Era, and the first major of the year. The tournament consisted of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed in singles and doubles tournaments. During previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.\n",
      "Novak Djokovic claimed the men's singles title, his tenth Australian Open title and 22nd major title overall, tying Rafael Nadal's all-time record. Djokovic was allowed to play this year despite remaining unvaccinated from COVID-19 after his three-year ban was lifted. The ban was initially handed to him after he was deported in 2022, as Australia's laws required foreigners to be vaccinated for entering the country when the tournament was played in 2022, but the ban was lifted as the vaccination requirement has been lifted. Nadal was the defending champion, but lost to Mackenzie McDonald in the second round. Aryna Sabalenka won the women's title, her first major singles title. Ashleigh Barty was the reigning champion in the women's singles, but she retired from the sport in March 2022.Spectators returned to full capacity for the first time since 2020, targeting to exceed 900,000 fans, after capacity restrictions in the last two events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.With the elimination of world No. 1 Iga Świątek in the fourth round by Elena Rybakina, this became the first edition of the Australian Open in the Open Era to feature neither of the top two singles seeds of either gender in the quarterfinals.\n",
